American.gxt Reversed.

Important note:

File ~MAIN.txt contains _mostly_ the entries from the MAIN section of teh gxt, and some entries from other sections (missions). 
Before using a string from this file, you should firstly check if it is located in teh main section of the american.gxt
Otherwise you should load a proper section with the LOAD_ADDITIONAL_TEXT() native function.
Other files contain only entries from the proper gxt section and go by its name.
