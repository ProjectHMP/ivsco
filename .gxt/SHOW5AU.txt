SHOW5_PT1_1 BBE0DD6C  ~z~~x~Time for depressing song with Ms. Bluesy St. John.
SHOW5_PT1_2 6A21B9EF  ~z~~x~Oh yeah...
SHOW5_PT1_3 D05B8661  ~z~~x~We're gonna take it down right now, talk about something that's happened to us all.
SHOW5_PT1_4 FE766296  ~z~~x~Talk about mixing our Goddamn metaphors, yeah.
SHOW5_PT1_5 F4C84F3A  ~z~~x~You know, like you went to your high school reunion and got drunk
SHOW5_PT1_6 A26B2A81  ~z~~x~and your car skidded off the road, and you was up the creek,
SHOW5_PT1_7 A62031FB  ~z~~x~the smell of rubber and petrol in the air?
SHOW5_PT1_8 F7C9554C  ~z~~x~Such a bad smell.
SHOW5_PT1_9 C972F8A0  ~z~~x~You know, when you wake up from that coma and you're in traction and in a bad way
SHOW5_PT1_10 6A48C0AB  ~z~~x~and in purdah and all you can think about is that cheerleader in high school,
SHOW5_PT1_11 6157AEC9  ~z~~x~but you'll never ever get back to Kansas.
SHOW5_PT1_12 4FCD0BB4  ~z~~x~And when you, over there, you look at your husband and your two children
SHOW5_PT1_13 4480F520  ~z~~x~at your hospital bed and you're disgusted - you're a dog without a phone.
SHOW5_PT1_14 354F56BD  ~z~~x~And you tell them to get lost and you leave the hospital and go straight to an S&M club.
SHOW5_PT1_15 288C3D37  ~z~~x~You meet a gal named Maggie who fancies herself a fingersmith of all trades.
SHOW5_PT1_16 16CD99BA  ~z~~x~And a year goes by and you're spending Thursday nights at a religious séance chanting Kifflom
SHOW5_PT1_17 CFE98BF3  ~z~~x~and afterwards going to a swinger cowboy bar named Saddle Tramps
SHOW5_PT1_18 FD2BE677  ~z~~x~and getting into drunken arguments about the Middle East or the middle distance, who knows?
SHOW5_PT1_19 B250D0BE  ~z~~x~You then marry a balding accountant, and you hold him to account.
SHOW5_PT1_20 9D86AABE  ~z~~x~I think it's happened to us all, really.
SHOW5_PT1_21 6461B875  ~z~~x~It's that crazy crap shot in a barrel called life!
SHOW5_PT1_22 7A21E3F5  ~z~~x~I'm gonna throw out a whole bunch of trite blues expressions right now for y'all. You ready?
SHOW5_PT1_23 40C3F13E  ~z~~x~Whiskey bottle... now
SHOW5_PT1_24 56891CC4  ~z~~x~Broken heart, oh, split liver
SHOW5_PT1_25 1D1229DB  ~z~~x~Planes, trains and anorexia
SHOW5_PT1_26 335C566F  ~z~~x~Night and dark
SHOW5_PT1_27 F96C6290  ~z~~x~Dark and night and night and dark
SHOW5_PT1_28 0FAD8F12  ~z~~x~Gender stereotypes, especially for women
SHOW5_PT1_29 D5F89BA9  ~z~~x~Cryin' alone at group therapy
SHOW5_PT1_30 E29874AD  ~z~~x~Where's my double ender?
SHOW5_PT1_31 B4C7190B  ~z~~x~I gotta charge my mobile phone
SHOW5_PT1_32 C70CBD96  ~z~~x~Man, I got the linguistic blues bad tonight
SHOW5_PT1_33 9ACFE51D  ~z~~x~You know, I'm so sorry, everybody. I don't know what the hell I'm singing about.
SHOW5_PT1_34 6C9588A9  ~z~~x~Oh, man, I'm so fucked up on meds right now.
SHOW5_PT1_35 7E642C46  ~z~~x~Can someone go get me a drink or something?
SHOW5_PT1_36 43DCB72C  ~z~~x~Sorry! No refunds. She's a victim of domestic violence.
SHOW5_PT1_37 5E0AEB88  ~z~~x~Now, let's toss your balls. It's Catch!
SHOW5_PT2_1 7570FCF0  ~z~~x~Catch the juggler, everyone!
