J2_CUT1_4 1DADE5A6  ~z~Does that worry you?
J2_CUT1_5 0B5940FD  ~z~When you marry a dragon, you gotta expect a few knights are gonna turn up to try to slay him.
J2_CUT1_6 89F93E3B  ~z~Jackasses, all of them, all of you.
J2_CUT1_7 799D9D84  ~z~-Nice talking with you.~n~-Whatever.

J2_CUT2_12 EDBDB237  ~z~I got a couple of things I want to talk to you about.

J2_CUT2_16 A6B42421  ~z~Ahh, fuck.
J2_CUT2_17 94F3808C  ~z~So, listen... we gotta bit of a problem with the Pavanos.
J2_CUT2_18 AC46AF32  ~z~Yes, I noticed that at your meeting with them.
J2_CUT2_19 BA994BD7  ~z~The way they look at us, we're bottom feeders! Always have been.
J2_CUT2_20 BBC36A23  ~z~We ain't a real family to them - just a bunch of Guernsey goombas.
J2_CUT2_21 CA7A8795  ~z~When things are cool, we're getting fucked.
J2_CUT2_22 D72420E8  ~z~I'm sorry to hear that.
J2_CUT2_23 EEF5508A  ~z~Ahh, sure.
J2_CUT2_24 06437F26  ~z~Listen, some of their boys are in town today, gonna collect their piece of an Alderney bookie ring.
J2_CUT2_25 3C886BAF  ~z~Word is they're at the Diner in Acter. Find 'em, and follow them to the meet.
J2_CUT2_26 21D7364D  ~z~You disrupt it, and I'll let you keep the money, but make sure you hit the Pavanos real hard! Capiche?
J2_CUT2_27 EB4CC92D  ~z~Yeah, capiche.
J2_CUT2_28 D0DD944F  ~z~Thank you...
